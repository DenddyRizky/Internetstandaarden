                    <p class="synopsis">Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered
                        to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures
                        called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind
                        enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly
                        terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not
                        born out of hunger but what appears to be out of
                        pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of
                        humanity began living within defensive barriers,
                        resulting in one hundred years without a single titan
                        encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered
                        when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly
                        impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for
                        survival against the man-eating abominations.
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands
                        of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his
                        life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey
                        Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless
                        humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Eren, his
                        adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman, and his childhood friend
                        Armin Arlert join the brutal war against the Titans and
                        race to discover a way of defeating them before the last
                        walls are breached.

                        It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki
                        left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, for intense
                        training following events which fueled his desire to be
                        stronger. Now Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of
                        elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan
                        which may threaten the safety of the entire shinobi
                        world.
                        Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the
                        horizon, he has changed little in personality—still

                        confident and possesses an even greater determination to
                        protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto
                        will carry on with the fight for what is important to
                        him, even at the expense of his own body, in the

                        dabbles further with the "time machine," attracting the
                        ire and attention of the mysterious organization SERN.

                        find themselves in an ever-present danger. As he works
                        to mitigate the damage his invention has caused to the
                        timeline, he is not only fighting a battle to save his
                        loved ones, but also one against his degrading sanity.

                        Corrupt politicians, frenzied nationalists, and other
                        warmongering forces constantly jeopardize the thin
                        veneer of peace between neighboring countries Ostania
                        and Westalis. In spite of their plots, renowned spy and
                        master of disguise "Twilight" fulfills dangerous
                        missions one after another in the hope that no child

                        In the bustling Ostanian city of Berlint, Twilight dons
                        the alias of "Loid Forger," an esteemed psychiatrist.
                        However, his true intention is to gather intelligence on
                        prominent politician Donovan Desmond, who only appears
                        rarely in public at his sons' school: the prestigious
                        Eden Academy. Enlisting the help of unmarried city hall
                        clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and adopting the
                        curious six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid
                        enacts his master plan. He will enroll Anya in Eden
                        Academy, where Loid hopes she will excel and give him
                        the opportunity to meet Donovan without arousing
                        suspicion.

                        Unfortunately for Loid, even a man of his talents has
                        trouble playing the figure of a loving father and
                        husband. And just like Loid is hiding his true identity,
                        Yor—who is an underground assassin known as
                        "Thorn Princess"—and Anya—an esper who can read people's
                        minds—have no plans to disclose their own secrets
                        either. Although this picture-perfect family is founded
                        on deception, the Forgers gradually come to understand
                        that the love they share for one another trumps all
                        else.

                        In the year 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia is
                        establishing itself as a dominant military nation,
                        starting with the conquest of Japan. Renamed to Area 11
                        after its swift defeat, Japan has seen significant
                        resistance against these tyrants in an attempt to regain
                        independence.

                        Lelouch Lamperouge, a Britannian student, unfortunately
                        finds himself caught in a crossfire between the
                        Britannian and the Area 11 rebel armed forces. He is
                        able to escape, however, thanks to the timely appearance
                        of a mysterious girl named C.C., who bestows upon him
                        Geass, the "Power of Kings." Realizing the vast
                        potential of his newfound "power of absolute obedience,"
                        Lelouch embarks upon a perilous journey as the masked
                        vigilante known as Zero, leading a merciless onslaught
                        against Britannia in order to get revenge once and for
                        all.

                        by a mystical tiger that only he seems to be unaware of.

                        At Suimei High, the Sakura-sou dormitory is infamous for
                        housing the school's most notorious delinquents. Thus,
                        when the relatively tame Sorata Kanda is transferred to
                        the dorm, escaping this insane asylum becomes his
                        foremost goal. Trapped there for the time being, he must
                        learn how to deal with his fellow residents, including
                        bubbly animator Misaki Kamiigusa, charming playboy
                        writer Jin Mitaka, and the ever-reclusive Ryuunosuke
                        Akasaka. Surrounded by weirdness, Sorata frequently
                        finds respite in his interactions with his one "normal"
                        friend, aspiring voice actress Nanami Aoyama.

                        When Mashiro Shiina—a new foreign exchange student—joins
                        the dormitory, Sorata is instantly enraptured by her
                        beauty. Underneath her otherworldly appearance, Mashiro
                        is an autistic savant, capable of world-renowned
                        brilliance in her art, yet unable to perform simple
                        daily tasks. After Sorata ends up in charge of taking
                        care of Mashiro, the two inevitably grow closer, with
                        Sorata's initial desire to escape the dormitory becoming
                        a forgotten goal.

                        Despite their eccentricities, every resident is
                        incredible in their own field, leaving Sorata to contend
                        with his own lack of any particular skill. With
                        brilliance all around him, he thus strives to become an
                        equal to their talent. Revolving around the hardships
                        and joys of its colorful cast, Sakura-sou no Pet na
                        Kanojo is a heartwarming coming-of-age tale of
                        friendship, love, ambition, and heartbreak—through the
                        lens of an ordinary person surrounded by the
